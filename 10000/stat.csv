What if architecture harnessed the power of the user instead of repressing it? By analyzing five significant housing communities in the Americas as open systems with rules, this thesis begins to discover parallels between seemingly disparate projects, independent of the stylistic stigmas that surround them. By questioning each project&#x2019;s social agenda and analyzing its physical form architecturally&#x2014;as planned and following occupancy&#x2014;the thesis attempts to establish a firmer basis for the broader and more effective use of rules by architects, whether in low-income housing or high-end development, whether encoded in structure, custom or law, adding a twist to the idea of environmental determinism by defining an architectural environment as more than just the built form."

The question is to explore whether architecture can build form without a clear process-based model to replicate. Furthermore, what implications are entailed by eliminating the boundaries between human, nature, and architecture. The issue includes major contributors from philosophy and the history of science such as Graham Harman, Timothy Morton, and Peter Galison, writing alongside architectural theorists and practitioners such as Antoine Picon, Catherine Ingraham, Ed Eigen, David Gissen, David Ruy, and many others."

My experience over the past eight years is reviewed here in brief.The diagrams illustrate how my ideas have developed through experimentation and process.From a viewpoint of &#x201C;interactive design,&#x201D; which gave birth to my thought processes, these cases of experimental design suggest that the concept of space design could be extended far beyond conventional boundaries. Thus interactive communication may be encouraged in a variety of fields thereby creating a fusion of disparate disciplines, which may previously have been considered to be irreconcilable."

Thomas Street School presents the idea of generosity of space, spatial continuity and connection to place as the primary influences on our experience of a building. Ideas of architecture as a facilitator, as the space for learning, reflection and growth, are embodied in the design of a secondary school. The school is rooted in its context, filtering the external environment and creating a place for students to flourish. Inside | outside, inherited landscapes and the school as a campus are all themes running through this thesis. The design of space for learning entail more than spaces in which formal teaching takes place. Education is a continuous process; architecture facilitates this process."

Students discuss the relationship of City Center to its immediate context and whether the appropriate materials and design decisions were made when taking the context into consideration. Sustainable design and construction, eco development, technology, mathematics, color and texture, and computation in architecture are some other topics that enter the discussion. \rIn addition students compared City Center Las Vegas to multiple precedents that share the same goals and intentions. Each project&#x2019;s location, concept, program, and functional requirements will be discussed and critically analyzed. This becomes a study and discussion of mixed-use spaces, relationships to their context, user experience, and what determines the success and failure of projects within the same category and scale."

It contains concrete and inspiring examples of strategies for design, land use/programme, the relation to the street, passenger flows and the collaboration of partners. The book is a collection of stories from over 25 experts all over the world: a collective product with lessons from planners, owners, managers and designers. In addition to many international examples and case studies, the book contains several interviews and research articles. It concludes with practical lessons for the reader to put into practice in their own cities."

It does not dictate, or demand, but instead persuades occupation, persuades perseverance, and allows the mind to find footing admits the fragmental anxiety of life. In the gap between those fragments, between the whole and the detachment, architecture must accept a precarious placement. As purveyors of space architecture is asked to live within the ambiguity set by a profession both ephemerally artistic and empirically definable. Architecture is the representation of the porous fragmentation of moral, ethical, legal, cultural, and economic factors brought into stasis. This fragmentation allows the places we dwell to become silent actors in the theatrics of the regularity of our lives. Standing firmly admits this division, between polemics of practice and ethics, architecture has located itself as a purveyor of space that defines more than program or client, but life itself."

DETAIL 1/2015 contains examples of roofs that have striking spatial forms both externally and internally. The angular timber structure over a swimming pool in England creates a complex space above the calm surface of the water. A holiday home in Sweden is playfully closed at the top by a series of concrete gables, while the pyramidal roofs of a museum in Ahrenshoop, clad in irregularly folded brass sheeting, are reminiscent of the thatched houses in the area."

By throwing out the tenets of Modernism, the whimsical novelty of their fanciful creations has enchanted a public bored with efficiency and logic.  The time has come to point out that these emperors of Mannerism wear no clothes, and to agitate for some discussion about where this architectural trend is taking us."

The work in here represents how I have developed my skills thus far as a designer, an explorer and most importantly, a thinker.  My intention has never been to pursue perfection but instead to pursue purpose.  Developing a meaning alongside the inception of the graphic and physical representations of a design is a skill that I have striven to develop throughout my time in architecture school.  The concept and the design serve as a mode of translation through which I wish to convey a sense of relevance and utility in the architecture I design for the human-scale of understanding and appreciation.\n\nI hope you enjoy."

In the process, the unit defines a new social agenda and aesthetic philosophy for transforming established design strategies, and lends conventional notions of sustainable design a new civic and cultural relevance.\n\nThe projects are all either located within or influenced by a Brazilian context, rich in sculptural, variegated landscapes and African as well as indigenous Indian influences. Innovative design proposals shown in this book illustrate symbiotic relationships between urban society, environmental conditioning and landscape by articulating ground organisations to mediate and synchronise both environmental and cultural flows."

In an era of declared crises&#x2014;economic, ecological and climatic, amongst others&#x2014;the notion of soft systems has gained increasing traction as a counterpoint to permanent, static and hard systems. Acknowledging fluid and indeterminate situations with complex feedback loops that allow for reaction and adaption, the possibility of soft systems has re-entered the domain of design. Bracket 2 critically positions and defines soft systems through 27 projects and 12 articles. From soft politics, soft power and soft spaces to fluid territories, software and soft programming, Bracket 2 unpacks the use and role of responsive, indeterminate, flexible, and immaterial systems in design."

http://issuu.com/nicholaspatrickthaddeusdurant/docs/nicholas_durant_ephemeral_intervent,"ISSUU - Ephemeral Interventions  Experimenting with the Performance, the Event and the Crowd. by Nicholas Durant",1,"This thesis proposes the strategic use of ephemeral architectural interventions as a tool to enliven residual spaces within the traditional city. The innate nature of many ephemeral interventions draws upon the participation and engagement of the public. This is an exploratory process into the problematic relationship of residual space as voids of underutilized potential within the urban fabric and seeks to establish an architectural precedent for dealing with these spaces in an ephemeral and reactionary manor. Using ephemeral interventions, participatory events and responsive components, attention can be brought upon residual spaces, inviting occupation, development and reconsideration with the intention of filling the voids within the urban fabric and creating more continuity within the modern city. Utilizing these strategies, a 21st century cultural center can be created that evolves, adapts and reacts to the mass will of the public over the whims of a single curator."

This acknowledgment provides the framework for a new form of public architecture that is physical, dialogical, and critical.

Students discuss the relationship of City Center to its immediate context and whether the appropriate materials and design decisions were made when taking the context into consideration. Sustainable design and construction, eco development, technology, mathematics, color and texture, and computation in architecture are some other topics that enter the discussion. \rIn addition students compared City Center Las Vegas to multiple precedents that share the same goals and intentions. Each project&#x2019;s location, concept, program, and functional requirements will be discussed and critically analyzed. This becomes a study and discussion of mixed-use spaces, relationships to their context, user experience, and what determines the success and failure of projects within the same category and scale."

We begin with a shared experience and approach to architecture, to help inform a foundation that may be carried forward into individual works, culminating in the collective MARS exhibition, summer 2014. Making lies at the heart of the studio as a way of thinking about and exploring architecture, this book, as an opening chapter to the year, represents the establishment of this ethos within Peter, Samuel and Michael. There is a shared understanding within the studio, that the act of production, be it a drawing, model or prototype, is an enriching and thoroughly useful mode of thinking. Making is therefore more than the conclusion of a process, but a feedback loop where ideas can be tested and decisions challenged, to ultimately inform built architecture."

Nature has given us the basic building blocks to create more harmonious environments for ourselves. If we apply what we observe from nature into our own urban environments we have an opportunity to reduce urban sprawl, reduce stress on infrastructure, reduce overall pollution, and increase the quality of life for ourselves and our community."

We have seen a plethora of images - portraying issues of power, desolation, abandonment, or optimism - collectively directing attention [and often times obsession] to any context which no longer resemble a previous image of itself. As a parallel to the massive amounts of creative energy and thought that have been pointed at the investigation of these sites, it begs the questions. So what? Now what? The collected projects of Ampersand Volume Six thrusts &#x2018;decline first-responders&#x2019; into one another, along with their stories, contexts, and agendas, concurrently reassessing the topic of decline, and detaching common tropes associated with it. Decline&#x2019;s siblings &#x2013; degradation, disaster, abandonment, and contamination &#x2013; all make cameos throughout the volume.

This event was a series of talks, discussions and workshops designed to ignite the debate on how urban design could support inclusive and sustainable urban development in Ghana. This Accra Revisited Conference was an OUTCOMES driven conference with relevant players from all sectors - government, finance, developers, creatives, residents and shareholders, collaborating to develop implementable enterprises for growth, working off existing development plans. Our aim was to raise awareness for urban matters and engage local and international stakeholders, decision makers, professionals and the general public in a discourse that revisited existing development plans and initiatives. As organisers, our aim was for this discussion to leave a legacy to encourage OUTCOMES."

The physical making, creating, building of things has naturally become the driving force behind the way I see and interact with design. Working with my hands to discover spaces has been an influential aspect to my work. The ability to understand the components and how they fit together, to me, is just as important as understanding the whole. Through three dimensional studies, materiality and the aggregation of elements I have developed a design sensibility that is all at once tactile, experiential and believable."

The definition of &#x201C;Ell&#x201D; is &#x201C;something added&#x201D;, acknowledging the beauty, mystery, and excitement that street art and abandoned sites add to the urban world."

The projects encourage the development of mixed-use commercial corridors, create a variety of places for public life, and shape an equitable environment for a broad cross-section of users."

Design, as a holistic process, can integrate conservation at multiple scales.\n\nCarver&#x2019;s Warehouse (1806, renovated 2006-07) is a potent symbol of Manchester&#x2019;s reinvention. Multi-scalar analysis examines its role as a historical anchor for Piccadilly Basin, a high-end office conversion, and the architectural details that made conversion a reality. The design approach &#x2018;new lease of life with the minimal intervention&#x2019; reflects that physically and visually minimal additions can have a great influence on cultural value."

In housing terms, that number roughly equates to 15,000 new households. The lack of accommodation has become a crisis for workers and their families moving into the city. The current plan is to house these workers in &#x201C;migrant workers&#x2019; camps or working men&#x2019;s villages&#x201D; in central Christchurch. This thesis investigates how the design of temporary housing for the workers can be integrated into the community, making it a place where there is a sense of dignity and pride. "

Spatial analyses are performed on the current urban morphology to establish a benchmark for the assessment of detail plans currently approved and proposed, providing a constructive criticism and the starting points for alternative strategies. In the framework of participatory planning, a regeneration plan will be proposed, borrowing fundamental concepts of planning theory and making use of rigorous and established Space Syntax methods to initiate the design process."

The approaches, ambitions and aims within each generation differ to such an extent that they can be called contrary. Each new generation of architects tries to reinvent it, extend its boundaries, resettle it in the context and on the ashes of the past. This yields a rich and stimulating discussion about architecture. This likewise displays the boundaries and infinite potential within the profession and this is probably the main driving force for the enthusiasm that we all share."

I was constantly involved in projects that dealt with incremental scales of design in both urban and rural contexts. The studios involved synthesis between the built and unbuilt , landscapes and structural systems. \nAt Pratt Institute, I took this understanding forward  with experimentation with digital media, amalgamating new avenues of interdisciplinary learning with core design.The projects are a conscious effort to address an urban idea with architectural intervention.\nThis book is a brief attempt at exhibiting this entire process of architectural learning through selected projects which have greatly impacted in realigning my role  as a designer."

Based on an international and interdisciplinary platform, Anatomy of a Street attempts to connect different discursive fields and disciplines as well as networks belonging to different geographical locations, cultures and histories between eastern and western Europe after the cold war."

After looking at the background of \nthe river, investigating its relationship with the city, interviewing inhabitants about their awareness of the hidden river and looking at existing related projects, I aimed to design an urban signage system interacting with weather conditions. The core of the project is to find \nthe right balance between visible and invisible. To trigger curiosity, \nto stimulate collective memory, to reveal the invisible."

I get to introduce the amazing work of our final year MArch students. I am so proud of what they have achieved at the end of their studies on the MArch programme. They have done so through their own talent and hard work, skilfully channelled, directed and challenged by the tutors who work in and with the School.\n\nThe diversity of topics on offer across the seven units has allowed the students to develop a rich set of skills they can put to immediate use in architectural practice. At the WSA we promote a creative pragmatism that balances strong conceptual design with a commitment to realising this work in practice. As one student said to an external examiner, the School is &#x201C;exploratory but grounded.&#x201D;\n\nThe future of architecture lies with these young women and men. When you see their work, I think you&#x2019;ll agree we are in safe hands.\n\nProfessor Chris Tweed\nHead of School"

The project is an alternative proposal to Northland Develop Co. of Massachusetts for the redevelopment of Church Street South in New Haven, CT. The site was previously redeveloped during Richard C. Lee&#x27;s urban renewal program in the late 1960s - based on a design by Charles Moore. Previously, during New Haven&#x27;s first city planning initiative in 1910, Cass Gilbert proposed a redevelopment that largely went unrealized. This project recommends renovating the existing complex and adding new development on vacant or underused portions of the site, but as an alternative to Northland&#x27;s redevelopment a new design approach is proposed."

In the last fifty years, design-related disciplines have informed a multitude of practices and conceptual frameworks exploring ways to qualitatively transform these sites. An enduring and highly disputed problem has remained the difficulty in assessing within which processes, and to which extent, the production of design strategies can acquire agency and have significant leverage effects within the informal sectors of contemporary cities &#x2013; thus effectively contributing toward the feasible amelioration of living conditions for their inhabitants."

A case study involves setting up an informal open-doors event in the club room of a rental housing complex in Kontula, Helsinki with the aim of envisioning the future development of the complex&#x27;s shared spaces with residents. A time-line visualising the social life and physical alterations of the shared spaces over time, along with sketch design proposals, are used as tools. It is found that this kind of event can stimulate longer term thinking, generate new ideas, help in quieter voices being heard, and lead to more robust design proposals. Facilitating such an event as part of an extended resident survey could be a means for an architect to ensure social considerations are embedded in all decision making regarding the planning of renovation work to apartment buildings."

Creating more transparency within cites; more thresholds and fewer boundaries.  Collaboration and equality are needed to create truly sustainable cities.  Cities where the population feel comfortable, as if they have a fair stake at what the urban environment has to offer.

It shows the latest developments in housing and places them in the context of important examples from the past 65 years.

A new feature - a diagram, a kind of figure-ground-plan, which accompanies each project - illustrates the unique characteristics and spatial qualities of each floor plan."

Revolution then is a slow, ever-evolving process responsive to a changing contemporary society. Within this investigation is a look at the role of the institution of art in realizing projects by practitioners whose production relies on contexts outside of the gallery."

In this project the initial process execution time of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection request has been reduced from some 60 days to two days. This has been achieved by the use of a new business process reengineering (BPR) implementation approach that was developed by the Utrecht University. The implementation approach is based on a combination of Enterprise Information Architecture (EIA), Business Process Modeling (BPM), Knowledge Management and Management Control methodologies and techniques. The method has been applied to improve the performance of a Dutch e- government service department (DeGSD). DeGSD is an e-government service department that supports and promotes electronic communication. It can be described as an electronic mail office for consumers that provides the ICT infrastructure to communicate with the government. The..."

Yet the on-going concentration of staff and offices in Brussels has created the need for the Belgian government to provide a setting for the European administration, which recognizes Brussels as a European capital. As a result, the contradiction between a widespread European network of administrative functions and a representative capital city has lead to the project of a problematic administrative district. A project that should have animated a civic and collective domain, but was given over to the interests of private developers: the European Union and its urban formation of Brussels has surrendered to the uncompromising interests of private capital."

While it is an iconic building of its era, it is located in the World Heritage Site where it doesn&#x27;t fit and only a few floors are used by tenants as it is outdated and close to be obsolete without refurbishment. The design brief looked into a redevelopment scenario for the area proposing new mixed use developments, a cultural and creative quarter for creative industries and people as well as the conversion of the Argyle House building to a new 3 star hotel.\nThis brief contains my part of the Site Analysis, Design Framework and Proposal, the Masterplan and my sketches and evolved ideas about the whole area extracted from the full version."

As a rule, their colours, forms, surface qualities and structures also have an impact on the appearance of the interiors. In this issue we present buildings with a range of exceptional facades, some of which frame views, while others exploit contrasts or have moving or movable components. At the Allianz Headquarters in Wallisellen, Switzerland, the supple fabric used in the curtains within the closed cavity facade is a foil to the regularity of the glazing. The curtains endow the office spaces with a &#x201C;liveable&#x201D; atmosphere. In another project, the finely articulated cast iron elements of a London shop facade ennoble an existing brick building. And at a residence near Munich, the coarse stucco surfaces and wood-clad cut-outs are composed in a manner that causes the inside and outside realms to become interlocked."

While in school, I began to explore furniture and woodworking, which then became my passion.  At RISD, I studied adaptive reuse, a form of architecture that uses existing historic buildings in which design-interventions fuse the new and old. This gives me a unique view of the balance between new and old. I have been looking for a place to pursue my dream of working with other artist and furniture makers, design, and custom furniture."

http://issuu.com/magdahogness/docs/collaborativeconsumption,ISSUU - Collaborative Consumption  Toward Inclusive Public Participation in Design by Magdalena Hogness,3,"As we seek to regenerate postindustrial waterfronts for public use, public involvement in the design decision-making process must be defined.  These projects are inherently complex, with large infrastructure components, high cost, and technical constraints.  This work explores different models of public participation using case studies from the Copenhagen Harborfront and the Stockholm Waterfront to compare to the current Seattle Waterfront Design Process.  The case study comparison demonstrates that more effort is needed to establish the role of local knowledge in decision-making.   Drawing connections between the practice of user generated design and research on public participation models, I propose an alternative approach that might help us develop more responsible and responsive strategies for designing with the local community. I argue for the method of collaborative consumption&#x2212;a sedimentation of user-generated design to shape public places&#x2212;and I test this method on Pier 48."

However, sustainable solutions specific to these dynamic urban forms and communities are unfamiliar academic territory. Extreme levels of poverty fostered in these communities cause deficiencies in a child&#x2019;s development, who are often without access to a formal, structured education system (UNDP, 1999). Public spaces are particularly stimulating environments for youth learning and development, but most urban environments in shanty towns host a milieu of violence and crime, making most public streets and vacant lots unsafe. \nData collected from the neighborhood via surveys, interviews, community meetings, and an auto-ethnographic video study with fifth and sixth grade students provided an introduction to the community and the larger themes and objectives for future public space design."

This project seeks to capitalize on these major investments by creating a Harlem River Green way that connects the wide range of experiences of the Harlem River waterfront, from manicured to natural landscapes and from industrial to residential neighborhoods. The Greenway winds along the Harlem River through the Highbridge and Mott Haven neighborhoods. \n\nThe Bronx, Meet Your Waterfront plan presents strategies that reconnect the river to its adjacent communities. Eco-puncture, temporary activation, waterfront access, and infrastructure adaptability have been applied to specific sites as a comprehensive strategy to bring people to the waterfront."

http://issuu.com/johnrtuthill/docs/dichotomy,ISSUU - Cal Poly Architecture Thesis  Dichotomy by John Tuthill,4,"Considering the great power of architecture, whether simply perceived or actual, we exist in a world of increasingly banal construction. No longer does our built environment inspire or provoke. Rather we live in a realm of uninspired strip malls and bland row homes. \n\nArchitecture has the power to destroy society, but it also holds the power to redeem. As the stability of our world becomes an illusion, we must turn outside the norm for salvation and remember what those in the past did. Let&#x2019;s change the world, and let&#x2019;s save ourselves."

This project, the fourth commissioned by the Kripalu Center, focuses primarily on wayfinding and connectivity around the property. This project builds upon the work of the three previous projects.\n\nThis current project, Landscape Wayfinding, builds upon the recommendations of the three previous projects, with a focus on how staff and guests can move more safely and seamlessly across the property, while creating minimal impact on the landscape and improving the overall quality of visitor experience."

The synergy of dance and design has been the focus of my design explorations since 1985. As a design mechanism the choreographed design uses kinetic principles as part of the design gestalt and takes the design process out of the static paper conceptual world into a virtual world which relies on three dimensional modeling as its primary vehicle. Elevation and plan are immediately merged into a volumetric realm from the beginning of the design process. Many other kinetic principles take place in choreographed spaces, such as the infliction of changing light on a material and or the tracking of the daily changes of the natural light over the period of a day.  Additionally the immediacy of visualization, of the three dimensional environments, give users a look into the future by seeing in almost any direction of the space that is envisioned."

Extending them diversifies the field of the application of flexibility. Fundamentally one can change one&#x2019;s environment not only through modification but also by changing one&#x2019;s location. Therefore, flexible environment is both adaptable as well as diverse, accessible and networked.  Considering movement a source of flexibility opens new development possibilities especially in the scale of a city block. It can e.g. provide one solution to the contradictory aims of housing design to build economically efficient housing on one hand and roomy multipurpose flats on the other hand. This kind of flexibility could be particularly applicable in e.g. cooperative building and co-housing. Moreover, movement-related flexibility may be useful in the design of densely built mixed-use blocks and contemporary public facilities the use of which modern information and communication technologies have changed."

In a society obsessed with the living in the moment, we are without universal identity. The architecture practice is struggling to make.... architecture. Buildings constructed today are evaluated in terms of economic restraint, timely schedules, and provided services. Introduction "

Red carries a primal weight for artist Daryl Howard and is a signature statement in her tiny gem of a hill country studio. The glazed skin of the newly built Richards Group in Dallas reveals a stunning array of interior colors each night. In an Austin office lobby, the blues and greens of the city&#x2019;s sky and landscape are translated into CNC-cut felt murals. Rand Elliott&#x2019;s use of color, both restrained and striking in the Marfa Contemporary, is on full display in a series of parking structures in his home state of Oklahoma."

http://issuu.com/nbgroves/docs/crafting_an_architectural_ecotone,ISSUU - The Engagement of Architecture &amp; Landscape  Crafting an Architectural Ecotone by Nick Groves,8,"An exploration of architectures ded&#xAD;icated to making the experience of the landscape accessible to humans. By examining the important role that the natural world plays with&#xAD;in human existence, the unique quali&#xAD;ties presented by architecture-nature relationships and the social and cul&#xAD;tural context of &#x2018;nature dwelling&#x2019;, a contribution can be made to the design of architecture that exists in site-specific engage&#xAD;ment with its context. The thesis propos&#xAD;es borrowing an ecological concept to develop the metaphor of an architec&#xAD;tural ecotone which serves to describe a realm of architecture that embodies transition and reconciliation between landscape and constructed form. A &#x2018;kit of parts&#x2019; design strategy is developed to investigate elemental, integrated and site-specific assemblies for &#x2018;nature dwelling&#x2019; in Bon Echo Provincial Park. These assemblies seek to rec&#xAD;oncile landscape-building conditions and provide the inspiration for the design of three retreats within the landscape."

We do not own the city. \nAnd by we, we mean people who are pushing the boundaries of urban development by taking matters into their own hands &#x2013; taking collective ownership. We are talking about people-driven urban initiatives that adopt an approach that is becoming an increasingly familiar phenomenon in our cities. Still, many conventional actors, such as institutions, architects, government offices and developers, find themselves out of touch and ill-equipped to effectively implement collaborative approaches that link the &#x2018;bottom-up&#x2019; with the &#x2018;top-down&#x2019; in development practices.\n\nWe Own The City aims to bridge this divide. This book reveals the vitality of diverse and dynamic bottom-up initiatives, brought to life in five major cities: Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Moscow, New York City and Taipei."

The U.S. Courthouse in El Paso directly relates to the region&#x2019;s geography while adhering to stringent security standards; the restoration of Ancient Oaks near Bastrop recaptures a once-lost sense of place through sensitivity to existing conditions; the Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg demonstrates how to tell a heroic story without overwhelming a small town&#x2019;s historic fabric; and Singing Bell Ranch offers its city-dwelling owners a getaway of &#x22;ranch pragmatism&#x22; and prevailing breezes. Other articles include a news update on the City of Austin&#x2019;s Great Streets program, two commentaries on the 82nd Texas Legislature, a profile of Sisters&#x2019; Retreat by Mell Lawrence Architects, and an account of how Ziegler Cooper Architects helped a historic church in Plantersville accommodate a sudden influx of members."

The larger purpose of this project is to form a base for the &#x22;integrated development&#x22; of Chinsurah where the goals of urban heritage conservation are intertwined into the economic social and cultural development of the town. The project methodology is guided by UNESCO Recommendations for the Historic Urban Landscape (2011), which is an approach to the management of heritage resources in dynamic and constantly changing environments. The project focuses on recognition of those values and attributes that define the meaning and sense of place of Chinsurah. It demystifies the various layers and interconnection of natural and cultural, tangible and intangible, international and local values that defines the town."

A network that we have tired to hide in our urban environments is re-thought. The residual\nspace between structures in urban environments goes largely unnoticed, yet consumes a large area of space. This thesis begins to unravel the nature and future roles of the residual space through investigation and new design. Realizing the depth of alleys reveals a new purpose, one that may begin to fill voids and add a new layer of discovery to our urban landscape. Through further exploration more can be understood about the alley and in turn we can begin to view them as places of destinations and means of travel."

However, once inside the megalomaniac building there was a softness, an architectural softness. A softness that is so characteristic of his work. This play with light, the unexpected light, has made a big impression on me, far away in India.\nLater on I visited Notre-Dame-du-Haut, Villa Savoye and maison La Roche. Never as a series, always separately."

Our objective is quite simply to design people-friendly spaces that enrich the public realm.

That is to say; one&#x2019;s disconnectedness from ecological systems and his placement of self above the biosphere, is the reason why, despite technical innovations and the &#x2018;green movement&#x2019;, environmental catastrophe threatens to be the end of human.\n\nThis project uses Malm&#xF6;, a city striving for sustainability, as an example of how sustainable environmental design can be challanged to go beyond measurable success.  Urban design can be used to create an understanding of our position within the ecosystem.  Looking specifically at public space in Malm&#xF6;, the project uses the lens of ecology to discuss design which exposes ecological systems in daily life."

How do we go about sensing that which we cannot perceive?

However, I believe that the essence\nof architecture should not be overwhelmed by any tools we use in the design\nprocess. It will always emerge from what we see, what we think and what we\nmake."

This architecture is deeply embedded in the particular: client, designer, time, site and region. It eschews mimicry of overwrought, conventional styles, shock value, pastiche elements, and superfluous ornamentation. The result is a powerful, graceful solution to the complex equation of the principles of nature and the distinctive character of the client, a unique structure carefully designed for living, growing, thriving."

Before that I worked with Arx New York, Per-forma Studio and firms in Middle East. My approach to architectural design is seeing it as an interdisciplinary activity for social and cultural change. Along with professional practice I have continued my research through teaching at Columbia GSAPP and Pratt institute. My area of specialty and interest that I have developed is performative/responsive systems. In different projects, using tools such as Rhino Grasshopper, Revit and further integration with other programs, mainly Ecotect Analysis, has been a big asset for me and helped me to develop and optimize building performance especially in facades and roofing systems and detailing it. \nMore information: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mazdak-jafarian/18/b46/bb9"

Thanks to the small size of LEDs\nand their long-lasting maintenance-free operation, these luminaries are able\nto be embedded and integrated perfectly in to buildings."

http://issuu.com/ben.strak/docs/villas_of_le_corbusier,ISSUU - Villas of Le Corbusier by Benjamin Strak,7,"This essay was completed as my undergraduate dissertation. It recieved the David Roberts Prize for the highest mark.  The 1920&#x2019;s villas of Le Corbusier are among the most recognisable pieces of his architecture, indeed of 20th century architecture as a whole. The three-quarters of a century of critical attention they have received tends however to confuse rather than clarify the question of how the architecture of these remarkable and significant buildings came to be. This essay will conduct a detailed historical investigation of two of these: the Villa Savoie and the Villa Stein-de-Monzie in order to develop an accurate account that measures the value of the various interpretations that have been offered based on their grounding in historical fact. In developing such an account a clearer insight into Le Corbusier&#x2019;s creative process will be gained &#x2013; though the premise it might ever be definitively known is questioned."

Against many years of URBANIZATION the project considers URBAN POROSITY as a way to solve these two problems at the expense one of another in order to achieve effective land use. The concept is approached at the under used area in South-Western part of Milan. Following main strategy of soil [re]naturalization in not-used industrial part of Milan, the project &#x22;Native|Nature Botanic Garden&#x22; proposes to reactivate abandoned concrete structure into a botanic exhibition and research centre. This building is a core of the natural forest. Inside the greenhouse 3 Italian climate regions of plants are presented. While outside - 4th climate zone, native to the city of Milan."

Doubling the local population with their presence, they&#x27;ve created new spatial definitions, paths and uses for the local space. Their dominant presence formed and altered existing boundaries in the little village. Our workshop became a laboratory of tools, patterns and interventions and a microcosm of border production and change."

First they suggest a reformulation of practices around networked\ncommunication infrastructures as conduits for the new orchestrations of power that Antonio\nNegri and Michael Hardt detailed in their books Empire and Multitude. They then describe\nhow such practices are often involved in the development of responsive sensing\nenvironments as new sites for manifesting the social organisations and communities made\npossible via telecommunications and the Internet. Lastly, they address how traditional\nboundaries of design disciplines and knowledge, from architecture to programming, are\nopening into complex co-minglings of their respective isolated &#x2018;intelligences&#x2019; into collectives\ncapable of engaging these new sites, new briefs and new sorts of projects."

By working with artists and closely observing the way in which they relate to urban space and engage other people, locally and globally, Nikos Papastergiadis provides a critical account of the transformation of art and public culture. He shows art has sought to democratise the big issues of our time and utilize new information technologies. While the concept of the everyday highlights the potential for transformation at the level of the individual, at the same time it has to be seen as a critique of broader structures; in this book Papastergiadis stresses the importance of situating a work within art history as well as relating it to its social context. Spatial Aesthetics will help artists, curators and cultural workers think about the ways they intervene in public life."

Through the analysis of case studies, of essays written by experienced professionals and participating students, together with projects designed as a group at the course, we will explore the real demand and agenda of education in architectural and engineering design today, and also how to train experts to learn know how to collaborate be-tween the two disciplines."

http://issuu.com/papress/docs/archigram_screen,ISSUU - Archigram by Princeton Architectural Press,13,"In late 1960, in various flats in Hampstead, a loose group of people started to meet: to criticize projects, to concoct letters to the press, to combine to make competition projects, and generally prop one another up against the boredom of working in a London architectural office. It became obvious that some publication would help. The main British magazines did not at that time publish student work, so that Archigram was reacting to this as well as the general sterility of the scene. The title came from a notion of a more urgent and simple item than a journal, like a &#x27;telegram&#x27; or &#x27;aerogramme,&#x27; hence &#x27;archi(tecture)-gram.&#x27;...By this time Peter Cook, David Greene, and Mike Webb, in making a broadsheet, had started a new Group."

Instead of an authoritative, top-down plan, this thesis devises a coordinated development strategy that provides a framework for local actors&#x2019; initiatives and establishes links to the surrounding vital environments that intersect with Panepistimiou. \n\n\n"

The hope of this is to let new architecture define itself for what it is within the fabric, rather than designing something that&#x2019;s primary goal is to look 100 years older than it is. The goal of this would be to promote growth back to the center where the identity of the city is defined, but economic density has left for the big box stores only promoting their own identity on the outskirts of the city."

Accordingly, the function of style would not reside in its formal originality, but in the way it appropriates and reconfigures the conventions relating built forms to everyday life. By reconfiguring conventional arrangements, architects can generate new encounters between people and the activities of their daily lives, disrupting habits by activating the natural human impulse to try to detect what is unfamiliar and inviting a creative response.\nPublished with Harvard University Graduate School of Design and FUNCTIONLAB."

They carry analysis and propositions for inhabitation of extraordinary post-industrial landscape between Detroit and Flint, Michigan. This masterclass re-interpretated unrealized visions of radical Western architecture from 1960&#x2019; and 1970&#x2019; amalgamated with archeology of socialist monuments from Eastern Europe built about the same time These projects are seeking contemporary aspects of inhabiting futures from the past. They are charged with ideologies that inspired them as symbols of the future and their ever dislocation of the everyday into forthcoming times. The projects drew future into the present and explored new typologies of inhabitation and their emerging monumentality. (eBook)"

Inside you will find simple illustrations that cover the necessities of drawing cool stuff. Specific exercises are provided that offer step-by-step guidelines for drawing a variety of subjects. Each lesson starts with an easy-to-draw shape that will become the basic structure of the drawing. From there, each step adds elements to that structure, allowing the artist to build on their creation and make a more detailed image. Starting with the basic forms, the artist is provided a guide to help see objects in terms of simplified shapes. Instructions for shading to add depth, contrast, character and movement to a drawing are then covered. The varieties of texture and pattern that can be included in an artwork offer another layer of interest and depth to a design."

http://issuu.com/jaymes.dunsmore/docs/dunsmorethesis,ISSUU - The Next Great American Station  Union Station and Downtown Los Angeles in the Twenty-First Century by Jaymes Dunsmore,0,"Ideas about a city are powerful forces, and have lasting impacts on the built environment. While not every vision is realized in the built form, every aspect of urban development is the reflection a vision about what the city should be. This is especially true in Los Angeles. Today, the ideas and trends that shaped the development of that city, and many American metropolises, in the twentieth century are falling away, presenting the opportunity for new visions of downtown development and civic space to take shape. This work seeks to understand the origins and effects of past visions for Downtown Los Angeles, critique the potential of current visions, and propose new ideas for urban development and public space, using the concepts of civic space and convergence as lenses and Los Angeles Union Station as a focal point."

Like the grain of sand that creates a pearl, Grit is an agitator and catalyst. The inaugural issue of GROUND UP peered into Landscapes of Uncertainty, examining who and what defines the next move in landscape architecture. This second edition asks how our field fulfills its potential by exploring grit as a quality, texture and approach for negotiating change in our landscapes. Shifts in climate and society call for responses and interventions grounded in courage and creative resolve."

Graphical analysis of inspiring masterpieces by a+t architecture publishers,117,"For the first time ever, a+t research group has conducted an analysis of ten inspiring masterpieces through drawings and texts highlighting the most important contributions made by each of the architects towards developing desirable housing. The book recognizes masters such as Ignazio Gardella, Jean Renaudie, Ralph Erskine and Fumihiko Maki, among others, who defended their own personal vision of architecture, a far reach from dogmatism and closer to users. Each story is a journey through multiple possible links which relate the project with works that preceded it, set it against those of its generation and match it up with recent 21st century designs.\rThis is neither a canonical list of buildings nor the top ten of collective housing. They were chosen as one chooses one&#x2019;s friends. Faults and all, they make everything worthwhile.\rSoon on sale"

http://issuu.com/papress/docs/think-make_screen,ISSUU - Think Make by Princeton Architectural Press,0,"Architecture, the saying goes, is a verb. It&#x27;s an ongoing process of creating. For Brooklyn-based architects Jared Della Valle and Andrew Bernheimer it is, more accurately, two verbs: think and make. Two words that, when fused in the work of Della Valle Bernheimer, energize and transform each other--architectural process as a feedback loop. Just a decade into their practice, Della Valle Bernheimer has assembled an impressive body of completed projects. Coveted commissions in New York City include two high-profile condo towers in Chelsea and the renovation of architect Paul Rudolph&#x27;s landmark modernist apartment at 23 Beekman Place. Think/Make documents twelve of the firm&#x27;s most innovative projects, ranging from residences to public commissions such as Federal Plaza in San Francisco; affordable housing units in the Bronx, New York; a public swimming center in Aalborg, Denmark; and a proposal for the reuse of New York City&#x27;s Hudson Yards."

The concept is based on the idea of creating an architecture that respects the idea of vernacular buildings by avoiding a single form in favour of an assemblage of smaller elements, akin to the typology of farm buildings. The house therefore divides into three functions; guest/study; living; and sleeping. These are used to create three interlocking forms that are clad in cedar above a white wall. A central chimney anchors the composition and rises above a black zinc roof that echoes traditional slate."

http://issuu.com/aaschool/docs/mediating_architecture,ISSUU - AA Agendas 11  Mediating Architecture by AA School AADP,1,"Given today&#x27;s multitude of demands on the built environment, the role of the architect has extended from being a mere designer and builder to acting as a mediator within a much larger network of expertise. This mediation takes place on multiple levels &#x2013; within the building industry, between public, clients and designers, and between public, clients and designers, and between the actual design and its environment. To achieve this, the field of work, the tools of design and the representation of architects needs to develop. The architect has to design the design process itself. Mediating Architecture demonstrates the extended role of the architect through the applied work of AA&#x27;s Diploma Unit 14 within London&#x27;s Thames Gateway over three consecutive years. A series of essays reflect this methodology from the multi-disciplinary perspectives of architecture, urban design, landscape design and philosophy."

Every design proceeds towards the stated goal based on the designer&#x27;s concept, the &#x22;idea - generator&#x22; that is, or his philosophy, which is the outcome of his collective experiences. For the public, design carries an aura of &#x22;mysticism&#x22; or romanticism. Naively at times, it is subconsciously perceived as a kind of a &#x22;black box&#x22;: an input at the one end of the box results in the rather speedy or magical output of what&#x27;s wished for at the other.

The focus of our work, from the very beginning, was on presenting ideas that would promote opportunities for economic development and revitalization that enhance the quality of life for area residents. It is our strong belief that economic and community development go hand in hand, and that there cannot be success in one without equalaccomplishment in the other.\rThe project includes not only the entire strip of East Second Street between Main and Atkinson, but Garden Avenue and the residential neighborhoods to the north and south as well."

What awaits us &#x2013; what kinds of products, what kinds of houses?\n\nThe fifty-and-over generation represents an enormous potential: in Germany alone, twenty million seniors have hundreds of billions of euros, but they hardly spend them for lack of suitable products. \n\nThis book provides answers from a sociological and design perspective for architects, designers, decision-makers, and firms who wish to respond to the demands of this diverse and discriminating target group. It investigates the various aspects of senior citizens&#x2019; lives from tip to toe and offers technical articles as well as authentic case studies and reports."

Platform 4 represents a selective sampling of agendas cultivated at the GSD during the last academic year, revealing a diverse mixture of projects, research, and events. Organized as a searchable database, this publication documents both site and situation at the GSD&#x2014;it is an institutional index. While Platform 4 records research trajectories from the past year, it also has the capacity to set agendas for future work. By framing a set of issues and topics, Platform 4 focuses attention towards particular areas of interest, allowing individual work to build on and contribute to a larger body of disciplinary knowledge. In that sense, the themes within this book become projective, they provide frameworks for future inquiry."
http://issuu.com/actar/docs/gsdplatform5,ISSUU - GSD Platform 5 by Actar Publishers,210,"The HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF DESIGN has always recognized the indispensable importance and values of architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, and urban design, yet has transcended their individual aspirations through intellectual cross-fertilization and collaboration. The material presented in this publication forms a small part of the incredible range and diversity of proposals and visions that our students and faculty have produced during the past academic year. This work is indicative of the School&#x2019;s commitment, as a global leader in the field, to exploring and articulating transformative ideas through the power of design. It is as important for us to share and communicate the outcome of our research and design investigations as it is to show the fertile circumstances and conditions for the making of these projects."

As a science centre the aim is to attract new talent to the maritime sector in Norway, which has for long been standing in the shadow of the oil-industry.\nTo do so the centre seeks to further develop the concept of a science centre as a platform for knowledge by incorporating research and education on top of the exhibition. The aim is further strengthened by the placement of the building on the site, and working with the relation to the landscape in a New Nordic understanding of place and identity."

Plinths are extremely important for the urban experience, which in turn is an important driver for the urban economy. The plinths might cover only 10% of the building, but determine 90% of the experience. Our book shows you how a good plinth &#x201C;works&#x201D; for a better street at eye level. It contains concrete and inspiring examples of strategies for design, land use/programme, the relation to the street, passenger flows and the collaboration of partners. The book is a collection of stories from over 25 experts all over the world: a collective product with lessons from planners, owners, managers and designers. In addition to many international examples and case studies, the book contains several interviews and research articles. It concludes with practical lessons for the reader to put into practice in their own cities."

Red carries a primal weight for artist Daryl Howard and is a signature statement in her tiny gem of a hill country studio. The glazed skin of the newly built Richards Group in Dallas reveals a stunning array of interior colors each night. In an Austin office lobby, the blues and greens of the city&#x2019;s sky and landscape are translated into CNC-cut felt murals. Rand Elliott&#x2019;s use of color, both restrained and striking in the Marfa Contemporary, is on full display in a series of parking structures in his home state of Oklahoma."

It offers an insight into the complex relationship between them: from the historical analysis and theoretical examination via an exploration of partial aspects such as the relationship between support structure and space or the graphic reflections by individual actors on the process of designing and building. As such, it provides architects and students with the&#xA0;tools for future cooperation.&#xA0;"

Although the projects vary in nature, they do share something in common: that they either serve the general public or are semi-public community spaces operated by the government or non-profit making organizations. These include museum, school, church, clinic, rehabilitation centre and community centre. To call it &#x2018;Institutional SPACE&#x2019; may best suit its magnitude. The museum projects covered in this issue bring a broad perspective. It spans from major architectural reconfiguration to specific room design, exhibition layouts, display facilities, and down to signages, lighting, display items and allocation of audio-visual systems. Besides the museum/gallery in the first section, other projects are put together according to their spatial nature for readers&#x2019; reference and comparison."

The Town of Hopkinton has charged its Upper Charles Trail Committee (UCTC) with developing the town&#x2019;s portion of the trail to meet the demands of rapid residential\ngrowth and provide a more environmentally sensitive transportation alternative. The UCTC hired a team from the Conway School to inventory the physical and environmental conditions along the railbed, and provide recommendations for multi-use trail routes while highlighting the opportunities that each trail provides to Hopkinton and the broader Upper Charles network."

Lizenn Publishing previously published the first Architecture in Steel collection in 2013 and the second collection in 2014. Since this series was launched, the architecture industry has been inspired to design buildings and interiors using steel. Architects, engineers, and construction contractors have found assurance in the quality of projects that use steel in their design. The recent growth in the use of steel is clearly evident, and the number of new high quality projects utilizing steel components has inspired this latest collection."

If once implemented or realised, will the programme still have a rational outcome, conducive to intentions; will a house be a home? As a method of examination I&#x2019;d like to look at the early work of OMA and Rem Koolhaas, a motivation generated from images I came across at a recent Surrealism exhibition in the Barbican. Images of a giraffe conversing with Villa Dall&#x2019;Ava in Paris, a project commissioned prior to OMA&#x2019;s first build."

The contemporary built environment is managed and influenced by data both visible and hidden. A wealth of information is now collected and stored from every aspect of our daily lives. Architects and designers are increasingly aware of the potential of data. It is now possible to collect and synthesize data to draw conclusions that allow one to make urban design and architectural decisions. This thesis proposes a development approach that uses data to design a mixed-use building in Seattle as a solution for increased density and population growth in the year 2050.

And durability suggests a long life span &#x2013; and low maintenance costs. An alpine chalet by meck architekten, for example, employs solid wood for everything from the load-bearing components to the tabletop. For the design of a residence with cyclopean stonework in Peru, Longhi Architects takes cues from Incan principles. At a new academic building at a university in Mittweida, Georg Bumiller stacks black prefabricated concrete units. The horizontal layering of the stone building envelope at a priory church in Leipzig by Ansgar and Benedikt Schulz emphasizes the material&#x2019;s sensuous properties. And we also present an exception: the temporary structures at the Expo in Milan."

The project addresses the shortcomings of the suburban strip mall: few interactions between users, and disconnection between users, building, and the site context. The multi-use design focuses on visual and physical interaction between users, activating the building with different &#x201C;layers of use,&#x201D; embracing environmental practices, and confronting local needs."

It removes the individualized experience of reading projecting itself into a collective realm while prompting conversation.

Rising population levels and a desire for rural living has left the countryside which surrounds our cities, the Green Belt, under threat from development. As residential growth occurs further and further away from the city centre the separation between where people live and work increases. This has resulted in cities devoid of homes and communities, not conducive to a sustainable city.\n\nUsing the City of Birmingham as a case study, this design research project examines how the principles and aspirations associated with suburban living can be brought into the city centre in order to mitigate encroachment on the surrounding Green Belt."

Here is where branding, celebrity and spin often falter.  \n\nIt is complex, identity; it shouldn&#x2019;t be subjected to simplification or reduction.  \nWe need deep description of who we are and how we work, where we live and how we fit.\n\nWhy look at identity, architecture and urbanism at this time?  \nThis is our twenty-fifth issue of On Site, a project that started very humbly and has evolved over the past twelve years to its present form.  At its core is On Site&#x2019;s identity as a venue for new voices, ideas and wide interpretations of architecture and urbanism.  \n\nOn Site describes the complexity of what we do."

These characteristics have, throughout history, inspired architects and architecture that sought to be in harmony with its place.\rIn our days, there are many aspects relating architecture to genius loci: the form of a building, its relation with the ground, the choice of materials, the way it is lit and ventilated. Out of these, Daylight &#x26; Architecture # 11 will specifically focus on the daylight aspect: How does the daylight situation in specific locations influence the life of people, and hence, how do buildings relate to the local daylight conditions? Where can we find the places that offer the most impressive, specific daylight experiences?"

However, good architecture is less about creativity and more about discipline. In my opinion, this is a very important key &#x201C;knowing what not to do&#x201D;. It is discipline in my field that generates functional and inspiring architecture. The main disciplines extend from the conceptual, cognitive, and ergonomic domain to human factors and the organization of system and space. These factors cover different scales from small objects, instruments, and products to the larger human scale of furniture and built from. The biggest scales are the design of the environment and systems, in this part sustainable design, passive heating and cooling systems are the most important disciplines for me. Cost and time are one of the most important issues in our professional work, so they have an affect on the other parts."

Such a comprehensive approach to architecture requires a concerted effort to understand what works best for a neighborhood, an urban center, or an isolated development. Feature articles spotlight the Wylie Municipal Complex, the Omni Hotel and Residences in Fort Worth, the City of Grand Prairie&#x2019;s The Summit, the Lora Jean Kilroy Visitor and Education Center at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston&#x2019;s Bayou Bend, and the Byrne-Reed House in Austin. Other articles include a commentary on the loss of the idyllic greenspace in front of the Kimbell Art Museum now that construction is underway to expand the museum, plans for new bayfront development in Corpus Christi, and the architectural improvements brought to tiny Albany due to its up-and-coming arts scene."

http://issuu.com/wouterpocornie/docs/research_thesis_-_identity_in_post-,ISSUU - Identity in Post-Disaster Re-Development (excerpt) by Wouter Pocornie,0,The large amount of actors involved in the reconstruction mission in Haiti have to find a way to work in an historically instable political situation and with recently rapid transforming economic and cultural development potential. Will Haiti rise as a nation to strengthen itself? The crisis poses danger as well as opportunities. The people of Haiti have deal with major losses and post-disaster psychological issues. The identity of the nation will transform. Will immigration take on new heights? As emigration and its resulting remittance indicate a strong potential for Haitian- stimulated (private) development. A nation domestically dominated by poverty has limited options to develop but from an historic point of view it seems to sustain due to its cultural resilience; its social capital. The issue is how to reduce vulnerability. It will have to undergo major transformation to locally agglomerate the process of development in order to decrease the vulnerability on long-term.

They keep in mind the role of the clients attitude towards an existing building, and, of course, there is the argument of cost savings and energy optimization attached to every aspect in their work.\n \n32 Examples with colour pictures, technical drawings and project data layed out for comparison makes this book useful in the planning stage of buildings.

What right should architect, artist, inhabitant, institution have in the shaping of this space within our city? And with what agenda? This dissertation reviews the recent temporary use phenomenon that has emerged in the planning, commercial and cultural spheres of London and considers situating these interim fleeting appropriations within the larger context of temporary use, thus uncovering their agendas whilst also exploring the potentials of this &#x201C;urban vernacular&#x201D;."

The group project presented tackles the issues and problems raised during the research by proposing an alternative to the development of housing, taking the El Harrach River as a context for a test site. The proposal offers a multi-scalar solution to the problem of housing, from the territory of the city, to the finer social relationships at the building block level. Therefore, elements of the proposal can be utilized and implemented elsewhere in the city taking into account necessary adjustments which due to the change in context. The scenario presented in based on the given conditions of the El Harrach River, in order to conduct a more thorough representation of an implemented prototype.

My strengths lie in my varied background and the experiences and skill-set I have developed through them. I have worked as an architect, interior designer and a design strategist. All different but uniquely connected in their process. I am curious about how buildings, technology, and environment seem independent but codependent on each other. Their co-existence defines the fundamentals of the integrated design process, an underlying attribute of sustainable design. I love understanding and reinventing the concepts of the triple bottom line applied to the built environment to enrich the user experience. This portfolio provides a small yet significant insight into my expertise and skills in the field of design integration, strategic planning and management and project execution. Enjoy!"

http://issuu.com/aaschool/docs/anti_object,ISSUU - Architecture Words 2  Anti-Object (Kengo Kuma) by AA School AADP,20,"An &#x27;object&#x27; is a work of architecture that is expressly cut off from its environment. Objects are not exclusive to any particular architectural style, but objectification has long been central to western architecture. Indeed, it might even be said to be the very strategy by which modernism succeeded in conquering the world. It is all-pervasive because it is consistent with the aim of the prevailing economic system: to transform virtually everything into a commodity. In Anti-Object, Kengo Kuma argues that this mindset prevents us from establishing a healthy relationship with the external world and suggests that an alternative form of architecture is not only desirable but possible as well."

The freefall of the economy leaves vacant space and spurs inventive reclamation through collective action. Drastic environmental transformation forces new paradigms of building, thinking, and living. What will be the character of space that emerges from this instability? How can design tactics initiate succession of under-used space? How do we represent process and temporality over traditional determinism? How long is temporary? Facing uncertainty in the landscape, how do we adjust our way of thinking to move past merely physical proposals to more open-ended operational strategies?"

The complex global situation and continuous fluctuations within these systems demand a new understanding and repositioning of the field. The contributions aim to respond to issues such as the failing economic and political systems worldwide, growing discontent with capitalism, unemployment, social injustice, and social media empowerment, if the discipline is to remain relevant and involved in the remaking of these structures. Zawia#00:Change will attempt to demonstrate whether architects are ready to embrace changing ideals and new modes of operation, and whether they are willing to help better people&#x2019;s lives rather than focusing on glorifying design or architecture."

The project is a unorthodox mixed used tower located in the urban core of Houston, Texas. The form and design was made possible by  incorporating advanced computer modeling techniques with the following design platforms:Rhino, Maya, and Qhull.\n\nMany thanks to Stylianos Dritsas with his post on integrating Qhull and Rhino on his website Jeneratiff.  Without such a post this project would have been extensively more complicated."

Our task was to re-define this triangle shaped industrial warehouse/Black Box Theater into a residential loft.  We proposed a symbolic re-interpretation of the space to the client [owner of the relocated theater] as a gesture to create a &#x201C;performance living space.&#x201D;  This idea created the sleeping box, a semi-transparent stage of interaction where a subtle sense of voyeurism is blended with natural tones to create a private area both separated and integrated into the 1400 sqft space.  Programmatic elements were introduced through a conceptual analysis studying the relationships between existing solid / void and public / private conditions.  Collectively, these elements transform the former experimental &#x201C;black box&#x201D; theater into the &#x201C;performance living space&#x201D; by engaging our awareness of domestic habitation, theatrical performance, ritual, and drama."

These properties are often key buildings within the local urban fabric and contribute to the area&#x27;s history. Liz Lake Associates has worked with a number of far-sighted developers to achieve high-quality and sensitive landscape settings for restoration and conversion projects. The key to our success is not only in understanding the historic importance of properties like these, but also in interpreting the developer&#x27;s vision for their potential clients. We have been able to balance relevant historic landscape details with high-quality, easily maintainable contemporary planting design to produce sensitive and stunning landscape settings for important properties that are starting a new chapter in their history."

Case studies were also researched to gain insight on urban areas, parks and plazas, and amenities that were implemented well into an urban space, as well as adaptive reuse projects that were similar to the reservoir. We also maintained open lines of communication with the stakeholders that currently use the park and were able to provide\ninsight about what was needed in the park."

His architecture goes beyond designs for conventional living and instead suggests a utopian avant-garde of living without barriers. The aim of this publication is to give this small, but highly unusual oeuvre the recognition and the place that it deserves within modernism. The different contributions should make visible the diverse aspects to be found in the work of the architect.  Edited by Angelique Campens Design by Thomas Desmet Published by ASA Publishers.

It questions what we are designing for."

This included choosing an existing site, and to later compile a booklet which displays all topic research, site and building study, precedent studies, existing and updated design and drawings, a program, preliminary design criteria, a design solution, and focus chapter. \n\nMy year-long investigation and design solution explored the value of creating a healthy balance between the built and natural environment. Using the interior space as tool to teach people about wellness and environmental stewardship, the project encourages users to live healthier lifestyles, and become responsible advocates. \n\nTo request a copy of the full 204 page booklet, email Ashley at ahall45@tigers.lsu.edu"
